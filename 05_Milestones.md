Project Milestones
Project Title
One-Click DevOps Deployment Platform

Introduction
The One-Click DevOps Deployment Platform is developed using an incremental approach.

Instead of implementing the complete deployment platform at once, the project is divided into multiple milestones. Each milestone introduces a specific technical concept and gradually transforms the project from a basic web application into a complete DevOps deployment platform.

The milestone-based approach helps in understanding the complete deployment lifecycle while maintaining a structured development process.

Milestone Overview
The overall project development can be divided into the following stages:

Conclusion

The milestone-based development strategy provides a structured path for building the One-Click DevOps Deployment Platform.

The project begins with a simple React and Node.js application and progressively introduces Git, Docker, AWS, Nginx, CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code, monitoring, and container orchestration.

This incremental approach makes the project suitable for academic learning while providing practical exposure to technologies and workflows used in modern Cloud and DevOps environments.
