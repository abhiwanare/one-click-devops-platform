One-Click DevOps Deployment Platform
Project Overview
The One-Click DevOps Deployment Platform is an industry-inspired DevOps project designed to demonstrate how modern application deployment platforms automate the software deployment lifecycle.

The platform allows a user to provide a GitHub repository URL and initiate the deployment process through a simple web interface.

The system is designed around the following deployment workflow:

GitHub Repository URL
        ↓
React Frontend
        ↓
Express API
        ↓
Deployment Controller
        ↓
Deployment Service
        ↓
Git Service
        ↓
Docker Build
        ↓
Docker Container
        ↓
Deployment Result

Introduction

Modern deployment platforms such as Render, Railway, Vercel, and similar cloud services simplify application deployment by automating multiple DevOps operations.

This project demonstrates a simplified version of such a deployment platform.

Instead of manually performing multiple deployment steps, the user can provide a GitHub repository URL and initiate the deployment process from the platform.

The project focuses on learning real-world concepts related to:

Software Deployment

DevOps Automation

Git & GitHub

Docker

REST APIs

Linux

Nginx

Jenkins

Terraform

AWS Cloud



---

Problem Statement

Manual application deployment generally requires several repetitive steps:

Clone Repository
      ↓
Validate Project
      ↓
Build Application
      ↓
Create Docker Image
      ↓
Run Docker Container
      ↓
Configure Networking
      ↓
Expose Application
      ↓
Verify Deployment

Performing these tasks manually can be time-consuming and error-prone.

The goal of this project is to automate these operations through a single deployment workflow.


---

Project Objective

The primary objective is to develop a web-based deployment platform where a user can:

1. Enter a GitHub repository URL.


2. Click the Deploy button.


3. Send the request to the backend.


4. Clone the repository.


5. Validate the project.


6. Build a Docker image.


7. Start a Docker container.


8. Perform deployment checks.


9. Return the deployment result.




---

---

Backend Architecture

The backend follows separation of concerns.

Request
   ↓
Route
   ↓
Controller
   ↓
Service
   ↓
Utility

Routes

Routes define API endpoints.

Example:

POST /api/deploy

Controllers

Controllers handle:

HTTP requests.

Request validation.

Calling services.

HTTP responses.


Controllers should not contain the complete deployment business logic.

Services

Services contain application and deployment logic.

Examples:

git.service.js
docker.service.js
deployment.service.js

Utilities

Utilities contain reusable helper functionality.


---

API

Deploy Repository

Endpoint

POST /api/deploy

Request

{
  "repositoryUrl": "https://github.com/username/repository.git"
}

Purpose

Starts the deployment workflow for the provided GitHub repository.

Example Response

{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Deployment completed successfully"
}

> The actual response structure should match the implementation in the backend.




---

Running the Project Locally

Prerequisites

Install the following software:

Node.js

npm

Git

Docker

Git


For cloud deployment:

AWS account

AWS EC2

SSH client



---

Clone Repository

Clone the project:

git clone <repository-url>

Move into the project directory:

cd One-Click-DevOps-Deployment-Platform


---

Frontend Setup

Move into the frontend directory:

cd frontend

Install dependencies:

npm install

Start the development server:

npm run dev

The Vite development server will provide a local URL in the terminal.


---

Backend Setup

Open another terminal and move into the backend directory:

cd backend

Install dependencies:

npm install

Start the backend:

npm start

If the project uses a development script:

npm run dev

The backend should run on the configured port.

Example:

http://localhost:5000


---

API Testing

The deployment API can be tested using:

Postman

PowerShell

cURL


Example request:

POST http://localhost:5000/api/deploy

Request body:

{
  "repositoryUrl": "https://github.com/username/repository.git"
}


---

Docker Workflow

Docker is used to containerize deployed applications.

The basic workflow is:

GitHub Repository
       ↓
Clone
       ↓
Dockerfile
       ↓
Docker Build
       ↓
Docker Image
       ↓
Docker Container
       ↓
Running Application

Useful commands:

docker images

docker ps

docker build -t application-name .

docker run -d application-name

> Docker commands may vary depending on the application's Dockerfile and configuration.




---

AWS EC2 Deployment

The platform can be deployed on an AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance.

A high-level deployment process is:

AWS EC2
   ↓
Install Git
   ↓
Install Node.js
   ↓
Install Docker
   ↓
Clone GitHub Repository
   ↓
Configure Backend
   ↓
Configure Frontend
   ↓
Start Application
   ↓
Configure Security Group
   ↓
Access Application

Future production-oriented deployment can include:

EC2
 ↓
Nginx
 ↓
Docker
 ↓
Application


---

Security

Security is an important part of the platform because the application processes external GitHub repositories and executes deployment operations.

Important security considerations include:

Validate repository URLs.

Avoid unsafe shell command construction.

Never expose secrets.

Do not commit .env files.

Do not commit private SSH keys.

Do not commit AWS credentials.

Apply appropriate container restrictions.

Validate user input.

Implement authentication before exposing the platform publicly.



---

Environment Variables

Environment-specific values should be stored using environment variables.

Example:

PORT=5000

Sensitive values should never be committed to GitHub.

Example:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-secret
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret

These values should remain private.

Recommended .gitignore entries:

node_modules/
.env
*.pem


---
