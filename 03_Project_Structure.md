Project Structure
Project Title
One-Click DevOps Deployment Platform

Introduction
The One-Click DevOps Deployment Platform is organized into two primary application layers:

Frontend
Backend
The frontend is responsible for the user interface and communication with the backend API.

The backend is responsible for deployment processing, GitHub repository handling, Docker operations, deployment management, and serving deployed application files.

The project follows a modular structure so that each component has a clearly defined responsibility.

21. Overall Code Organization

The complete application can be understood as:

PROJECT
                       |
          +------------+------------+
          |                         |
          v                         v
      FRONTEND                    BACKEND
          |                         |
          |                         +---- Controllers
          |                         |
          |                         +---- Routes
          |                         |

          |                         |       +---- Git
          |                         |       |
          |                         |       +---- Docker
          |                         |
          |                         +---- Utils
          |                         |
          |                         +---- Deployments
          |
          +---- React
          |
          +---- Axios
          |
          +---- CSS

22. Request-to-Code Flow

When a user starts a deployment, the request travels through the following components:

User
 ↓
App.jsx
 ↓
services/api.js
 ↓
Axios
 ↓
deployment.routes.js
 ↓
deployment.controller.js
 ↓
deployment.service.js
 ↓
git.service.js
 ↓
docker.service.js
 ↓
utils/shell.js
 ↓
Deployment Environment
 ↓
Deployment Result
 ↓
Frontend

This flow demonstrates the separation between the user interface, API layer, business logic, infrastructure operations, and deployment output.

23. Design Principles

The project structure follows the following principles:

Modularity

Different responsibilities are divided into separate files and directories.

Separation of Concerns

Frontend, API routes, controllers, services, utilities, and deployment files have separate responsibilities.

Reusability

Common operations such as shell command execution are centralized in utility modules.

Maintainability

A modular structure makes debugging and future development easier.

Extensibility

The current structure can be extended with additional services such as:

Nginx

Jenkins

Terraform

AWS services

Monitoring

Authentication

Kubernetes


24. Recommended GitHub Structure

For the final GitHub repository, the project can be organized as:

one-click-devops-platform/
│
├── backend/
├── frontend/
├── documentation/
├── .gitignore
└── README.md

Generated dependencies such as node_modules should not be committed to GitHub.

Conclusion

The One-Click DevOps Deployment Platform follows a clean and modular project structure.

The frontend focuses on user interaction, while the backend is divided into routes, controllers, services, utilities, and deployment workspaces.

This organization makes the project easier to understand and provides a strong foundation for future DevOps features such as CI/CD, cloud deployment, reverse proxy configuration, monitoring, authentication, and container orchestration.
